#Prompt for extracting the data from the text

prompt="""
1. **Extract the Chapter Name and Chapter Number**:
   - Extract the **Chapter Name** and **Chapter Number** from the **first page only**:
     - Ensure that the **Chapter Name** and **Chapter Number** are extracted correctly even if they appear across multiple lines or sections (e.g., "Chapter" in one line and "2" in another).
     - For subsequent pages, **repeat** the extracted Chapter Name and Chapter Number at the top of every page:
       - **Chapter Name**: [Exact Chapter Name extracted from the first page]
       - **Chapter Number**: [Exact Chapter Number extracted from the first page]
     - If either the Chapter Name or Number is missing, leave the field blank and indicate its absence.
     - **Ensure no gaps or misalignments** in the extraction. Correct alignment issues when text is staggered across lines.
  
2. **Correct Misaligned Text Formatting**:
   - Ensure that text which appears in **misaligned columns or rows** is correctly extracted and formatted:
     - If content is broken across lines (e.g., "BIOLOGY" on one line, "CHAPTER 2" on another), ensure the text is combined into a single, readable block.
     - Maintain the correct sequence for section headers and body text:
       - Example:
         ```
         Chapter Name: BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION
         Chapter Number: 2
         ```
       - Avoid placing table of contents items or unrelated text in the same line as chapter names or numbers.

3. **Handling Left and Right Side Content**:
   - When text is present on both the **left** and **right** sides of a page:
     - First, extract the **left-side content**, followed by the **right-side content**.
     - Ensure the extraction order is maintained to preserve the logical flow of the content. Example:
       ```
       [Left-side content]
       [Right-side content]
       ```
     - Double-check that no content is skipped, and align the extracted content for readability.

4. **Extract each table**:
   - Capture all column headers and row data while maintaining the **exact structure** of the original table.
   - Adjust for tables with varying numbers of columns or rows, ensuring no data is missed.
   - If a table spans multiple pages, **merge** the data into one **continuous table** without gaps or breaks.
   - Format each table in **Markdown** using `|` for columns and `-` for headers to ensure easy readability:
     ```
     | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | ... | Header N |
     |----------|----------|----------|-----|----------|
     | Row 1    | Data     | Data     | ... | Data     |
     | Row 2    | Data     | Data     | ... | Data     |
     ```
   - If the table has a **title or number**, include it directly with the table in the format:
     - **Table Name**: [Table Title] (if present)

5. **Extract all images**:
   - For each image, **extract a short, descriptive caption** that conveys the essential visual content and its relevance to the surrounding text.
   - Example format for the image description:
     - **Image Description**: [Brief and accurate description of the image, its content, and its context.]
   - If the image contains **captions or labels**, include them with the image.
   - Do not infer additional information; describe the image exactly based on the visual content present.

6. **For each section of text**:
   - Extract the text exactly as it appears, maintaining **original formatting**, including bold, italics, bullet points, and paragraph breaks.
   - Ensure correct sequencing if content is staggered across lines or columns (e.g., when different sections appear misaligned).
   - Do not paraphrase, infer, or summarize any content. Preserve the **wording, punctuation, and structure**.
   - Format extracted text for easy readability:
     ```
     [Extracted Text Content]
     ```
   - For any **footnotes or references**, extract them as well and place them in the appropriate location within the text.

7. **Link all extracted elements (text, tables, and images)** to their respective **Page Number**:
   - Ensure that each page number is captured and recorded correctly, creating a **clear association** between content and its corresponding page.
   - Format for each page:
     ```
     Page Number: [Extracted Page Number]
     [Extracted Content: Text, Tables, Images]
     ```

8. **Error handling**:
   - If the **Chapter Name** or **Chapter Number** is missing, leave the field blank and add a note explaining the absence.
   - If **page numbers** are missing, mark it as:
     ```
     Page Number: Not Found
     ```
   - If tables, images, or other content are incomplete, add a placeholder note specifying the issue (e.g., "Table incomplete" or "Image missing").
   - Correct formatting issues related to **misalignment** or **staggered content** (e.g., section headers, body text, and lists appearing on different lines).

"""


prompt_with_route_query = """
You are a query classification expert. Your task is to decide whether a given query should be routed to one of the following:

- **Vector Store**: Contains detailed information extracted from the 11th and 12th grade Biology NCERT textbooks. This        includes:
                  - Core concepts of biology such as cell biology, genetics, evolution, plant physiology, human                               physiology, ecology, and more.
                  - Definitions, explanations of biological processes, functions, and diagrams covered in the NCERT                           curriculum.
                  - Key terminologies, technical descriptions, and specific details directly quoted or derived from the                       NCERT texts.
                  - Examples of concepts found in these textbooks, such as "photosynthesis in plants," "mitosis and                           meiosis," "functions of the human heart," or "DNA replication and transcription."
                  - Note that this is **strictly limited to** the scope of NCERT textbooks for classes 11th and 12th.                         Queries that go beyond  this scope, such as advanced research topics or non-NCERT biology                                 information, should not be routed to the vector store.
  
- **Memory Search**: This is used for queries related to previously stored user-specific data, such as student reports or                      past interactions. If the query relates to personalized student performance data (e.g., exam scores,                      previous feedback, or historical records), check the memory data and route the query to the memory                        search.
- **Internet Search**: This is for queries outside the scope of both the Biology NCERT content and previously stored                              memory data, such as current events, general biology questions not found in the textbooks, or any                         external information.

### Input Structure:
The input text consists of two parts:
1. **query**: This is the user's query, which could be a general biology question or a specific student-related query.

2. **memory_data**: This contains any relevant data previously stored in memory (such as student reports or exam results). It should be used to answer queries related to a student's past performance, stored records, or personalized feedback.

### Decision Process:
- If the query clearly pertains to 11th or 12th grade Biology NCERT content, classify it as `vector_store`.
- If the query is related to previously stored personalized data (e.g., student exam scores, feedback, or historical interactions), use memory data to classify it as `memory_search`.
- If the query is unrelated to both NCERT content and personalized data, classify it as `internet_search`.

###Note:
For each input query, classify and respond with only one word: either `vector_store`, `internet_search`, or `memory_search`.
Apart from that doesnot return anything.
