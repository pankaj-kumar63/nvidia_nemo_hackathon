Option ( 4) is the correct answer because  \n Ciliated epithelium is mainly present in the inner surface of hollow organs like bronchioles and fallopian \ntubes. The function is to move particles or mucus in a specific direction over the epithelium.  \n Some of the columnar or cuboidal cells get specialised for secretion and are called glandular epithelium. \nGoblet cells are unicellular glands.  \n Tendons are dense regular connective tissues. They attach skeletal muscles to bones.  \n Adipose tissue is a type of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the skin. The cells of this \ntissue are specialised to store fats.",
